CLIENT-SERVER MODEL

The client requests information (starts the communication) to the server, and the latter sends a response.

The client might be a mobile phone, a tablet... a computer. So will be the server. Both of them might not be unique.

When we test these client-server applications, usually we don't have two computers... client and server can be both held in the same computer.


INTERNET

Network that connects client and server. Inside it there are many isolated computers that are connected to each other and divided in groups
called networks.

IP addresses are needed for the clients' computer to be identified and sent the information to. One computer can have more than one IP.
Network interfaces are established among computers that are connected to a wireless network.
